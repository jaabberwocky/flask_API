# Simple Flask API

Getting my feet wet with the following in a Flask application:
- API JSON responses
- SQLite3 DB

To run this:
1. Run the database creation script
```bash
python db_creation.py
```

2. Run the flask app (note that the DB has two test entries in it)
```bash
python simpleAPI.py
```
